//
// This folder is where each feature lives in isolation to the rest of the app except that 
// it uses parts of the ui folder.
//
// Each feature has its own components and hooks folder, specific to the feature. 
// If the feature is super involved it can have its own utils and services folders as well.
//
// This strategy has the huge benefit that it makes it very easy to remove features
// and not have leftover.
